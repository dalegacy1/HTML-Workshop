    <p>
        Coding, ain't no easy shiâ€¦ buh we keep on going regardless. Freecode camp is one of the best websites to use if you wanna learn how to become a great web developer. With the help of freecode camp, I have been able to make multiple websites on my own and I plan to make more websites and some that can help Ghana become a great country. I intend to design a website that will help my college in many ways cos we got a lot of problems. With freecode camp, I know I can achieve my aim. You wanna create websites? Start with freecode camp; its never too late, until it is.
